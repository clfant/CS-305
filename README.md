Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    Artemis financial needed help securing their clients information. They needed us to consult and determine the best way to secure the information being transmitted. They need some kind of encryption to keep the information safe. 
    
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
    I identified and secured the code by creating multiple layers of security. This is important because it protects the customers information from leaking to unauthorized people. This adds to a companies wellbeing because if the consumer feels their information is safe then they will stay with the company and therefore increase the longevity of the company.
    
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
    Identifying false positives was somewhat difficult for me but I ultimately feel that I was able to identify them correctly.
    
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
    I created a hash function to encrypt the data being transmitted. This protects becuase the only way to decrypt that data is with the key. In the future, I might create a login method to only allow authorized users to see the data.
    
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    I looked through the code and used the flowchart to identify vulnerabilities. I then added the code needed. I then ran another dependency check to determine if any new vulnerabilities popped up.
    
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    Dependency checks and using the people around me helped me identify a lot of things. From there, I made the changes I needed to to make the code secure.
    
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
    I would show my process in identifying vulnerabilities and fixing them.
